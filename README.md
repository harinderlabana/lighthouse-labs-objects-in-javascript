## Introduction

### About the Instructor

My name is Warren Uhrich, I'm a human person, instructor, and world-wide web developer hailing from Alberta, Canada!

### Lighthouse Lab Lectures

Welcome to a Lighthouse Labs programming lecture! Here are a few things to keep in mind as you attend:
- Spend most of your time listening and asking questions.
    - Write out small experiments, see what happens; code-along sparingly.
    - It is easy to get carried away trying to type _everything_, careful!
- Discussion is key.
    - Ask questions, don't be afraid to speak up!
    - The sooner you ask, the more it will be related to what's being taught in the moment.
    - Zoom has a text chat and a "raise your hand" feature, if you feel it is a moment where you may otherwise be interrupting.
- Lectures are recorded.
    - If you want to review something, or take extra notes, feel free to watch the recording at your leisure.
