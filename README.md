### Lighthouse Lab Lectures

Welcome to a Lighthouse Labs programming lecture! Here are a few things to keep in mind as you attend:

- Spend most of your time listening and asking questions.
  - Write out small experiments, see what happens; code-along sparingly.
  - It is easy to get carried away trying to type _everything_, careful!
- Discussion is key.
  - Ask questions, don't be afraid to speak up!
  - The sooner you ask, the more it will be related to what's being taught in the moment.
  - Zoom has a text chat and a "raise your hand" feature, if you feel it is a moment where you may otherwise be interrupting.
